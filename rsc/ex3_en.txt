When they reeched France they were pakked into trians, which stoppped and
started and crawled all day along the overcrowded tracks.  The country didn't
look so diferent.  Pepole worked the feilds just as the lads had done bac home.
Some of the workeers unbent their backs and waveed as the trains went bye.  The
solidiers finaly arrived at a small station that had grown into a vast supply
depot.  Trains and trucks were being shunted and unloaded.  Moutains of stores,
horse lines and mule liens were everywhere and ther was a babel of shouted
commands. Then at lsat they were of the trains and marching. Will felt god to
bee out in the fresh air and swinging along with his maets.
